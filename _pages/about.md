title: "About Me"
---

I’m a UX/UI designer with a background in editing and instructional design. I have experience working in the education, healthcare industries and several Fortune 500 Companies, where I specialized in project management, teaching and mentoring. In my role, I managed projects from initial phases to the final product. Communicating and empathizing with customers has always been the most important element of my role. Recently, I became a hospice chaplain, however because of the pandemic, I decided to help people in another way and move into user experience design. Incorporating both my computer background, and creativity, I want to build satisfying product experiences and solutions. Now, I’m excited to start creating impactful experiences through design that will simplify people’s lives and have a positive impact on society.
